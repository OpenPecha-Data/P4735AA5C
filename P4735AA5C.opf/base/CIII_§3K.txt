(3K) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, there are certain women or men with a natural bent for washing
their hair and putting on jewellery, who might decide to look at themselves in a vessel
of clear oil, or a vessel of clear water, or a wellpolished round mirror, or a patch of ground
smeared with azurite. If they see therein their own forms, Bhadrapāla, what do you think?
Does that appearance of the forms of the men or women in the vessel of clear oil, or
vessel of clear water, or well-polished round mirror, or patch of ground smeared with azurite
mean that there are men or women who have gone inside those things or entered them?'Bhadrapāla
said: 'No, Reverend Lord, it does not. Rather, Reverend Lord, because the oil and
water are clear and undisturbed, or the round mirror is highly polished, or the patch of
earth smeared with azurite is clean, the reflections stand forth; the bodies of the men or
women have not arisen from the water, oil, mirror, or patch of earth, they have not come
from anywhere nor gone anywhere, they have not been produced from anywhere, nor have they
disappeared anywhere.'
