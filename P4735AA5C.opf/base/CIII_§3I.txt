(3I) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, a certain man travelled from his native land to another country,
and arriving there he called to mind his native land; while concentrating his thoughts
on things as he used to see, hear, know, and perceive them he was overcome by torpor and
lethargy, and fell asleep; in a dream he travelled to his native land and perceived himself
to be there, and he saw those things just as he formerly used to see, hear, discern and
be aware of them; he went both to and from that place. Waking up, he reported those things
in the company of his relatives, friends, kinsfolk, and maternal relations, saying:"Thus
did I go, these things I saw, these things I experienced in that place.'"'In the same manner,
Bhadrapāla, bodhisattvas, whether they are householders or renunciants, should, when they
hear that a Tathāgata resides in such and such a quarter, concentrate on the Tathāgata
in that quarter with mindfulness and undistracted thoughts, in order to obtain a vision of
the Buddha. In that way those bodhisattvas will see the Tathāgata [like] a beautifully set
up beryl image.
