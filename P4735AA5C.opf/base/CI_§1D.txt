(1D) Then at that time the Lord performed such a working of magic that all those bhikṣus staying
and living in different regions came to the great city of Rājagṛha, to the Haunt of the
Kalandakas in the Bamboo Wood, to the place where the Lord was, and having on their arrival
prostrated themselves at the Lord's feet and circumambulated the Lord three times, they
sat down to one side in the Lord's presence, such was the working of magic that he performed.And
so at that time there were one hundred thousand bhikṣus gathered together and seated
in the Haunt of the Kalandakas in the Bamboo Wood.Then at that time the Lord performed
such a working of magic that thirty thousand bhikṣuṇīs headed by Mahāprajāpatī Gautamī came
to the great city of Rājagṛha, to the Haunt of the Kalandakas in the Bamboo Wood, to the
place where the Lord was, and having on their arrival prostrated themselves at the Lord's
feet and circumambulated the Lord seven times, they sat down to one side in the Lord's
presence, such was the working of magic that he performed.
