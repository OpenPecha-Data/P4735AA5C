(1S) (85) become those who are like an illusory person in their lack of conceit or misconception
(Skt. manyanā) with regard to all dharmas; (86) become those who are like phantoms in
having dharmas which are unproduced, do not come into existence and do not pass away; (87)
become those who are dreamlike in their understanding of the three times; (88) become those
who are like reflections in manifesting their own bodies in all world-systems (Skt. lokadhātu);
(89) become like echoes in possessing the dharma which neither passes on nor abides,
yet is unlocalised; (90) become those who are like shadows in all their deaths and births;
(91) become those who abide in the cognition of non-existence by eliminating the apperception
of existents (Skt. bhāva-saṃjñā?); (92) become those who apply themselves to the
dharma of marklessness (Skt. alakṣaṇa) by the habitual absence of duality; (93) become those
whose aspiration to awakening (Skt. bodhicitta) is so measureless that the dharma-realm
(Skt. dharma-dhātu) is their ultimate end; (94) become those who are unshakeable in all
world-systems through the unshakeability of their mental processes; (95) become those whose
sphere of activity is unattached in all Buddha-fields;
