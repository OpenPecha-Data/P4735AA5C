(1J) Then the bodhisattva and mahasattva Bhadrapāla, having risen from his seat and arranged
his upper garment on one shoulder, put his right knee to the ground, extended his joined
palms towards the Lord, and said to the Lord:'Your Reverence, if the Lord would give me the
opportunity to have the questions I ask answered, then I would question the Lord, the Tathagata,
Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One, on a certain matter.'When this was said, the Lord
said to the bodhisattva and mahasattva Bhadrapāla:'Bhadrapāla, question the Tathagata,
Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One on whatever you wish, and by answering those questions I
shall gladden your mind.
