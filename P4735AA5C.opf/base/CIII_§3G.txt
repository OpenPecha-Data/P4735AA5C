(3G) 'After they developed that samādhi and concentrated themselves in that samādhi, those bodhisattvas,
when they emerged from that samādhi, came to you, Bhadrapāla, and told you about
that samādhi. Then, Bhadrapāla, you taught the Dharma so that those bodhisattvas became
unable to regress from supreme and perfect awakening. Then I also predicted that at a future
time those men would become Tathāgatas, Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones under the
name of *Prāptapratibhāna.''Bhadrapāla, you yourself, the Elder Mahākāśyapa, the bodhisattva
Indradatta, the bodhisattva Susīma and, moreover, the bodhisattvas who have obtained this
samādhi, have gained mastery from this samādhi.'
