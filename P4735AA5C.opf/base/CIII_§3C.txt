(3C) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, women or men in dreams while sleeping neither know if they are
at home nor know if they are elsewhere, and their faculty of sightis not obstructed by walls,
nor is it darkened or obscured. In the same way, Bhadrapāla, those bodhisattvas and
mahāsattvas too conceive a thought in such a way that the spaces between worlds do not obstruct
them, that Sumeru, King of Mountains, the Cakravāḍa;la and the Greater Cakravāḍa, Kings
of Mountains, and similarly the Black Mountains do not obstruct their faculty of sight;
those bodhisattvas do not see the Tathāgata through obtaining divine vision, do not hear
the True Dharma through obtaining the divine faculty of hearing, and do not travel instantaneously
to that world-system through obtaining magic power, but while remammg in this very
world-system, Bhadrapāla, those bodhisattvas see that Lord and Tathāgata Amitāyus, perceive
themselves as being in that world-system, and also hear the Dharma.And they retain, master,
and preserve those dharmas after hearing them expounded. They honour, revere, venerate
and worship that Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One Amitāyus.And on
emerging from that samādhi the bodhisattvas expound at length to others those dharmas, just
as they have heard, retained, and mastered them.'
