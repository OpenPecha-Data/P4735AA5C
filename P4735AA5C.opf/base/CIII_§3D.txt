(3D) BAMPO TWO 'For example, Bhadrapāla, one man living in the great city of Rājagṛha heard
that there was a courtesan in the city of vaiśālī called Sumanā; a second man heard that there
was a courtesan called Āmrapālī; and a third man heard that there was a former courtesan
called Utpalavarṇā.Having heard of them they fell in love with them, each with each; without
those men ever having seen those courtesans, but just through hearing of their names,
appearance, and beauty, they came to have lustful thoughts.While repeatedly thinking about
them, they went to sleep, and in their dreams they perceived themselves as having visited
those courtesans, so that, in accordance with the lustful thoughts which those men conceived
while they were awake in the great city of Rajagrha, when they fell asleep those men
dreamt in a dream that they saw those courtesans, consorted with them, indulged in sexual
intercourse, and were relieved of their sexual desire.On waking up they remembered what
they had experienced in their dreams, as they had seen, heard, known and perceived it, Bhadrapāla,
and coming to you they related those things to you. Having heard those things you
taught the Dharma to them by means of this very teaching, so that they would become unable
to regress from supreme and perfect awakening.I too predicted that at a future time those
men would become Tathāgatas, Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones under the name of *Suvibuddha.Although
those men have attained patient acceptance (Skt. kṣānti), they still see and
recall those former appearances.'
