(2B) 'Bhadrapāla, there is a samādhi called "Direct Encounter with the Buddhas of the Present";
if one preserves that samādhi without forgetting it, if one listens to it attentively
and succeeds in being mentally undistracted, then those excellent qualities will not be difficult
to obtain.'Then the bodhisattva and mahāsattva Bhadrapāla said to the Lord:'Reverend
Lord, would the Tathāgata therefore please expound that samādhi, which would be for the
benefit of many beings, for the happiness of many beings, out of compassion for the world,
and for the welfare, the benefit, and the happiness of the great body of beings, of devas
and of humankind; and which would shed a great light for future bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas.'Then
the Lord said to the bodhisattva and mahāsattva Bhadrapāla: 'In that case,Bhadrapāla,
listen well and consider it carefully, and I shall expound it to you.'
