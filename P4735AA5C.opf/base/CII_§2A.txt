(2A) When this was said, the Lord said to the bodhisattva and mahāsattva Bhadrapāla:'Well done,
Bhadrapāla, well done! You, Bhadrapāla, have set out for the benefit of many beings, for
the happiness of many beings, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, the benefit,
and the happiness of the great body of beings, of devas and of humankind, and you have
done well, Bhadrapāla, in deciding to question the Tathāgata in such a way on this matter.''You,
Bhadrapāla, have done your duty and created wholesome potentialities (Skt. kuśala-mūla)
under former Jinas; you have worshipped many hundred thousand koṭinayutas of Buddhas;
you aspire to the Dharma; you desire the Dharma; you lead the holy life in non-objectification;you
arouse bodhisattvas, delight bodhisattvas, teach bodhisattvas, inspire bodhisattvas,
fill bodhisattvas with enthusiasm, instruct bodhisattvas, bring bodhisattvas to fulfihnent;
you desire the welfare of bodhisattvas,you have great compassion (Skt. karuṇā),
you have equanimity towards all beings, possess the excellent perfection of complete mastery
of the mind; possess the vision of the Buddhas, are great in vows, have the profound as
your sphere of activity, aspire to omniscience (Skt. sarvajñatā), uphold awakening, teach
