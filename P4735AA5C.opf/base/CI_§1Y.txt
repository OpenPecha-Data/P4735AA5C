(1Y) (145) become those who do not aspire to opportunities for rebirth in any of the states
of being; (146) become those who see the Buddha-fields of Buddhas and Lords resident in other
world-systems, and hear the Dharma, retaining it and not forgetting it, yet it is not
[due to the operation of] the five extraordinary faculties (Skt. abhijñā), nor [due to the
operation of] the six extraordinary faculties, nor are those bodhisattvas in those Buddha-fields
after having passed away from this world-system, but those bodhisattvas, while staying
in this very world-system, see the Buddhas and hear the Dharma, and retain it all, that
is, just as 146 am free of any doubt or uncertainty as I stand in the Lord's presence now,
so too those bodhisattvas become those who are never deprived of the sight of the Buddhas
or the hearing of the Dharma, even in their dreams--what is the samadhi [which produces
all these qualities and abilities]?"Chapter One of the Samadhi Enquired of by Bhadrapāla"
