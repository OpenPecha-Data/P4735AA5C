(3N)1 '"Thought creates the Buddha, thought itself sees him. Thought is the Buddha, thought
the Tathāgata. Thought is my body, thought sees the Buddha. Thought cannot itself know thought,
thought cannot itself see thought. Thought with [false] apperceptions is stupidity;
thought without [false] apperceptions is Nirvāṇa. These dharmas lack anything enjoyable? They
are all produced by thinking. Since thinking is empty, then whatever is thought is thus
ultimately non-existent." Bhadrapāla, such is the vision of the bodhisattvas established
in the samādhi.'
