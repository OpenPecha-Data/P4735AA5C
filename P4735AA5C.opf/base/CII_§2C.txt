(2C) Saying: 'So be it, Lord,' the bodhisattva and mahāsattva Bhadrapāla and the world with
its devas, humans, asuras and gandharvas listened to the Lord, and the Lord then said:'Bhadrapāla,
if one dharma is practised, cultivated, developed, frequently rehearsed, mastered,
actively pursued, made to arise, made familiar, fully purified, fully concentrated on, and
fully undertaken, then one will become distinguished by all good qualities.What is the
the one dharma? Namely, the samādhi called "Direct Encounter with the Buddhas of the Present",
which brings to fulfilment the dharrnas of which the first is great learning (Skt. bāhuśrutya).
