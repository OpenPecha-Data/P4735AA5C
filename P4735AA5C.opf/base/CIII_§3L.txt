(3L) The Lord said: 'Well done, well done, Bhadrapāla! You have done well, Bhadrapāla. So it
is, Bhadrapāla. As you have said, because the forms are good and clear the reflections appear.In
the same manner, when those bodhisattvas have cultivated this samādhi properly, those
Tathāgatas are seen by the bodhisattvas with little difficulty. Having seen them they
ask questions, and are delighted by the answering of those questions.In thinking: "Did these
Tathāgatas come from anywhere? Did I go anywhere?" they understand that the Tathāgatas
did not come from anywhere. Having understood that their own bodies did not go anywhere either,
they think: "Whatever belongs to this Triple World is nothing but thought. Why is that?
It is because however I imagine things, that is how they appear."'
