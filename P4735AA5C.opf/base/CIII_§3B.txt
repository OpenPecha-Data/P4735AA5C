(3B) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, some men or women in dreams while sleeping see various material
forms, see silver, gold, friends, kinfolk, maternal relations, or companions that are pleasing,
dear, and not disagreeable to them, and in those dreams they dream of playing, dallying,
and amusing themselves with them, of speaking and conversing with them. When they
wake up they relate to others all those things and people that they saw, heard, thought, were
conscious of, spoke and conversed with; and they shed tears at recalling the things which
appeared (Skt. nimitta) in their dreams. In the same way, Bhadrapāla, bodhisattvas, whether
they be householders or renunciants, go alone to a secluded spot and sit down, and in
accordance with what they have learned they concentrate their thoughts on the Tathāgata,
Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One Amitāyus; flawless in the constituent of morality and unwavering
in mindfulness they should concentrate their thoughts on him for one day and one
night, or for two, or three, or four, or five, or six, or seven days and nights.If they concentrate
their thoughts with undistracted minds on the Tathāgata Amitāyus for seven days
and nights, then, when a full seven days and nights have elapsed, they see the Lord and Tathāgata
Amitāyus.Should they not see that Lord during the daytime, then the Lord and Tathāgata
Amitāyus will show his face to them in a dream while they are sleeping.'
