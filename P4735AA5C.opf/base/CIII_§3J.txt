(3J) 'For example, Bhadrapāla, when a bhikṣu performing the meditation on the repulsive sees
in front of him bloated corpses, when he sees in front of him corpses that have turned blue,
that are putrefied, that are bloody, that are gnawed, that the flesh has peeled from,
or that have no flesh or blood, or are white, or the colour of shells, or those that are skeletons,
then those things-from the blue corpse to tJ1e skeleton--have not come from anywhere,
nor have they gone anywhere. They are not made by anyone, nor are they made to cease
by anyone, yet, Bhadrapāla, by that bhikṣu's mastery of mental focussing he sees the skeleton
lying in front of him.''In the same manner, Bhadrapāla, whatever quarter Tathāgatas,
Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones might dwell in, those bodhisattvas who are supported by
the Buddha and established in this samādhi concentrate their minds on that quarter, in order
to obtain a vision of the Buddhas. By concentrating their minds on that quarter they see
the Tathāgatas, Arhats and Perfectly Awakened Ones in that quarter. Why is that? Namely,
Bhadrapāla, this obtaining .Qf a vision of the Buddhas is the natural outcome of this samādhi.
Bodhisattvas who are established in this samādhi see the Tathāgatas, and they appear
to them, through the combination and concurrence of these three things: the might (Skt.
anubhava) of the Buddha, the application of the force of their own wholesome potentialities,
and the power [which is the result] of attaining samādhi.'
