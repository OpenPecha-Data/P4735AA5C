(3F) 'Having been asked this question, the Lord and Tathāgata Amitāyus said to those bodhisattvas:"Sons
of good family, if the calling to mind of the Buddha (Skt. buddhānusmṛti) is practised,
cultivated, developed and rehearsed, then one is reborn in this world-system. If
the calling to mind of the Buddha is practised, cultivated, developed and rehearsed, then
one will be reborn in this Buddha field.What then, sons of good family, is the calling to
mind of the Buddha? It is when one concentrates on the Tathāgata in this way: 'He, the Tathāgata,
Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One, the Accomplished in Knowledge and Conduct, the
Sugata, the Knower of the World, the Leader of All Men Capable of Conversion, the Supreme
One, the Teacher of Devas and Humankind, the Buddha and Lord,9 endowed with the thirty-two
marks of the Great Man and a body with a colour like gold, resembling a bright, shining,
and well-set golden image, and well adorned like a bejewelled pillar, teaches the Dhanna in
the midst of an assembly of sravakas, that is, teaches to the effect that nothing perishes.What
does not perish? Earth does not perish. Water, fire, air, beings (Skt. bhūta), the
devas, Brahmā and Prajapati do not perish. Fonn does not perish. Feelings, apperception,
predispositions, and consciousness do not perish;'and one does not misconceive, does not objectify
(Skt. upalabhyate), does not fixate on, does not falsely perceive, does not falsely
imagine, does not falsely discriminate, and does not review the Tathāgata: 12 when in this
way one obtains the samādhi of emptiness by concentrating on the Tathāgata without objectification,
that is known as the calling to mind of the Buddha.'"
