(3E) 'In the same manner, Bhadrapāla, bodhisattvas who possessed this samādhi of Direct Encounter
with the Buddhas of the Present heard of the Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly
Awakened One Amitāyus, while they were in this very world-system. Having simply heard of
that Tathāgata's name, appearance, and qualities, with undistracted thoughts they called
to mind the Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened One Amitāyus. By repeatedly
concentrating on him they saw that Tathāgata. Established in the bodhisattvas' samādhi of
Direct Encounter with the Buddhas of the Present, when they saw that Tathāgata, they asked
the question: "Lord, what dharmas must bodhisattvas and mahāsattvas possess to be reborn
in this world-system [of yours]?" In this way whenever one wishes to be reborn in any Buddha-field,
one asks the Tathāgata[of that Buddha-field].'
