(3A)'Bhadrapāla, since those dharmas will produce samādhi, what then, Bhadrapāla, is the samādhi
which is produced by those dharmas? It is the samādhi called "Direct Encounter with the
Buddhas of the Present.'"'And what, Bhadrapāla, is the samādhi called "Direct Encounter
with the Buddhas of the Present"? In this regard, Bhadrapāla, any bhikṣus or bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas
or upāsikās who observe morality perfectly should go alone to a secluded spot, sit
down, and think: "In which quarter does the Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened
One Amitāyus live, dwell, reside, and teach the Dharma?"In accordance with what they
have learned they concentrate on the thought: "That Lord, the Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly
Awakened One Amitāyus now resides, lives, dwells and teaches the Dharma, surrounded and
attended on by a host of bodhisattvas, in the world-system of Sukhāvatī, one hundred thousand
kotis of Buddha-fields to the west of this Buddha-field;" and they concentrate their
thoughts on the Tathāgata with undistracted minds.'
