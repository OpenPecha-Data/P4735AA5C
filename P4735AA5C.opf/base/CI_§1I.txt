(1I) the four asura Lords also, with many hundred thousand koṭinayutas of asuras; the nāga Kings
Nanda and Upananda also, with many hundred thousand kotinayutas of nagas; the naga King
Anavatapta also, with many hundred thousand kotinayutas of nagas; the naga King Manasvin
also, with many hundred thousand kotinayutas of nagas; and the naga King Elapatra also,
with many hundred thousand kotinayutas of nagas came to the place where the Lord was, and
having on their arrival prostrated themselves at the Lord's feet and circumambulated the Lord
three times, they sat down to one side; such was the working of magic that he performed.And
so at that time this Trichiliomegachiliocosm (Skt. trisāhasra-mahāsāhasra-lokadhātu),
in the space overhead and up to the level of the Brahmaloka, was so crowded with highly
exalted devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras and mahoragas that one
could not even have found enough room to insert the point of a staff.
