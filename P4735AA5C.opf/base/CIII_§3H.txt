(3H) 'Bhadrapāla, fonnerly, in the past, a certain man travelled into a deserted wilderness,
and having become hungry and thirsty was overcome by torpor and lethargy; he fell asleep,
and in a dream obtained a great quantity of food and drink. On obtaining it he ate his fill,
and his hunger and thirst vanished.When he awoke, neither his body nor his belly had grown
any larger, and so he thought: "There exist certain dharmas which are so, that is, like
a dream; understanding that to be so he obtained the patient acceptance of the fact that
dharmas are not produced (Skt. anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti); and he also became unable to
regress from supreme and perfect awakening.'In the same manner, Bhadrapāla, if bodhisattvas,
whether they are householders or renunciants, hear that a Tathāgata resides in such and
such a quarter, and concentrate their thoughts on the Tathāgata in that quarter, they will
obtain a vision of the Buddha. They should not entertain the apperception of an existing
thing, but should entertain the apperception of empty space; being properly established in
the apperception of empty space, by concentrating their thoughts on the apperception of
a Buddha, those bodhisattvas will see the Tathāgata face to face, beautiful and resembling
an image of beryl; those bodhisattvas will see such a Tathāgata, Arhat and Perfectly Awakened
One.'
