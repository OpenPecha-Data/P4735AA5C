On the one occasion when I heard the following the Lord was staying at Rājagṛha, in the Haunt
of the Kalandakas in the Bamboo Wood, together with a great assembly of five hundred all
of whom were arhats, in whom the noxious influences (Skt. āsrava) were eliminated, who were
free of the defilements (Skt. kleśa), had attained mastery, done their duty, performed
their tasks, laid down their burden, obtained their own goal, destroyed the fetters of existence,
whose minds were fully liberated by perfect understanding, who had attained the excellent
supremacy of complete mastery over their minds, and obtained the eight emancipations--with
the exception of one person, namely, the Venerable Ananda.
