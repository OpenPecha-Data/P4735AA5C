(3O) Then at that time the Lord uttered these verses:[1] "'By thought is the Buddha produced;
And by thought alone is he seen. The Buddha is only thought for me, Thought alone is the
Tathāgata.[2] Thought alone is my body, And the Buddha is seen by thought.Thought alone is
my awakening; Thought itself is without essence (Skt. svabhava).[3] Thought does not know
thought, Thought does not see thought.The apperception of thought is ignorance, The non-apperception
of thought is Nirvāṇa.[4] These dharmas are insubstantial, They all arise from
(mis)conception.Whatever is conceived with regard to emptiness, That conception is here
empty."'Chapter Three of the Samadhi Enquired of by Bhadrapāla CHAPTER FOUR
