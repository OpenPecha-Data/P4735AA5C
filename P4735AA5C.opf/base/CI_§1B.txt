(1B) On that occasion the bodhisattva and mahasattva Bhadrapāla had come out from the great
city of Rājagṛha and, in order to hear the Dharma, was in attendance on the Lord, along with
five hundred bodhisattvas who were all householders and upholders of the five rules of
training (Skt. pañca-sikṣāpada).And so it was that the bodhisattva and mahasattva Bhadrapāla,
after emerging in the late afternoon from secluded meditation, went to the place where
the Lord was, and having on his arrival prostrated himself at the Lord's feet and circumambulated
him seven times, he sat down to one side in the Lord's presence.Those five hundred
bodhisattvas too, after emerging in the late afternoon from secluded meditation, came to
the place where the Lord was, and having on their arrival prostrated themselves at the Lord's
feet and circumambulated the Lord seven times, they sat down to one side in the Lord's
presence.
