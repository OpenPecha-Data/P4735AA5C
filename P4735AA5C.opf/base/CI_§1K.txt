samadhi is it, established in which bodhisattvas and mahasattvas (1) become those whose
learning (Skt. śruti) is like the sea, who have an accumulation of learning; (2) become
those who are free of doubt, free of uncertainty, and free of perplexity; (3) become those
who are not deficient and not defective in supreme and perfect awakening (Skt. anuttara-samyaksaṃbodhi);
(4) become those who are not reborn in any of the benighted states (Skt. akṣaṇa),
and who remember their rebirths; (5) become those who, even in their dreams, are not
deprived of the vision of the Tathagatas; (6) become fair of form, beautiful, handsome,
and endowed with the highest excellence of splendour and beauty; (7) become those who are
of high birth and noble lineage; (8) become those whose personal following is numerous, whose
personal following is inseparable;
