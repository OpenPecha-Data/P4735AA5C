(1C) Those five hundred bhikṣus too, after emerging in the late afternoon from secluded meditation,
came to the place where the Lord was, and having on their arrival prostrated themselves
at the Lord's feet and circumambulated the Lord seven times, they sat down to one side
in the Lord's presence.At that time also the Venerable Śāriputra and the Venerable Mahāmaudgalyāyana,
after spending the rainy season in the great city of Śrāvastī, journeyed in
due course through the land together with five hundred bhikṣus, and came to the great city
of Rājagṛha, to the Haunt of the Kalandakas in the Bamboo Wood, to the place where the Lord
was, and having on their arrival prostrated themselves at the Lord's feet and circumambulated
the Lord three times, they sat down to one side in the Lord's presence.
